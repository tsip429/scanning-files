# scanning-files

# SYNOPSIS
# project in c that scans input from a file until the end of the file and counts the amount of characters. If it's greater than 80 
# prints an X and then the line, if it's less than 80, prints the number of characters and then the line - includes spaces and tabs
# if a tab is used, counts as at most 8 spaces, depending on how many characters precede the tab

# MOTIVATION
# For projects in my classes all projects had to be less than 80 characters in width for style purposes - this project is an easy way
# to count the amount of characters

# TESTING
# make a separate file and put in to this source file as input and the output should match the expected output for the test
